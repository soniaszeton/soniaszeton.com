          <p>With a little bit of sandpaper, wood stain, and a lot of yarn, an old piece of a chicken coop became a canvas. I started by looking at cross stitch patterns, trying to find one that had dimensions that would work within the frame. Then I made a mockup on Illustrator to to use as a guide. From there it was just about putting in the time and filling in each square one loop at a time.</p>

        <p>My sister, bless her heart, is lactose intolerant, which makes choosing desserts for her much more difficult. My baking skills pretty much top out at Funfetti cupcakes, add on the challenge of not using butter or milk and I’m pretty much done for. Fruit might be a copout, but who says it has to be boring? I created this fruity version of the Colorado flag to welcome her back after a year away from home.</p>

        <p>I made this for my sister when she graduated nursing school. She’d requested an embroidered bandana that she could wear while hiking in the Summer, <i>‘Lost in the right direction’</i> felt like a fitting sentiment for both hiking and graduating.</p>

        <h2>Embroidery</h2>
        <hr class="otcs-sep" style="border-color: #32C2F1;"></hr>
        <p>After watching so much Jane Austen growing up, I was always curious about embroidery. I decided to start with a hot air balloon, and chose tulle because it would give it the illusion of floating in midair. It was interesting working with a transparent fabric, I had to be more careful about hiding all the knots in the back.</p>

        <hr class="otcs-sep" style="border-color: black;"></hr>
        <p>Nothing says ‘Congratulations!’ like yarn wrapped wine bottles. I’m pretty sure I was the only one in the liquor store choosing bottles of wine strictly by the shape of the bottle and the color of the seal. I wish I knew more about wine, it’s extremely likely these bottles were the definition of style over substance. Never the less, they were wrapped with love and finished off with handmade ribbon roses and a crisp bow tie with matching pearl buttons.</p>

        <hr class="otcs-sep" style="border-color: gray;"></hr>
        <p>This began as an assignment for my Material class. Like all great projects this one started at a thrift store. As I wandered the ailes filled with ceramic duck figurines and broken Shake Weights, a vintage pink cake pan struck me as particularly jellyfish-like. I was able to find 2 brass candle holders to serve as the center of the jellyfish, and a bunch of discarded skewers that would become the tentacles. </p>

        <hr class="otcs-sep" style="border-color: #FFBA21;"></hr>
        <p>Not being much of a cook myself, I was asked to bring a fruit salad to Friendsgiving while my other kitchen savvy friends handled the more complicated dishes, such as the cranberry sauce and instant mashed potatoes. I may not like to cook, but I do like to craft, and thus the fruiturkey was born -- with accompanying Nutterbutter and Hershey Kiss acorns of course (a classic pairing).</p>

        <p>As a Colorado native, mountains will always have a special place in my heart. One of the more simple projects, this one just took some paper, a sheet of foam board, an exacto knife, a touch of gold paint, and an afternoon to put it all together.</p>

        <p>With an exacto knife, some foam board, 15 lbs of concrete, and a very obliging Ikea bowl, this planter was born. I loved the idea of a planter with a topographic pool of water. I started by measuring out and sketching the topo layers, then cut out each layer in foam board before finally fitting them into the bowl and pouring each layer one by one.</p>
